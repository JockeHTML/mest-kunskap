Mest Kunskap, project i made for a client that needed his website upp to shape.

My first real project to someone else but myself. Main goal was to get the client happy with the result but also learning how to work with someone elses data.
And of course keep working on my coding skills, focusing to keep the code as clean as i can and worked alot on the dropdown menu.

Made with React, HTML, CSS, JS, Material-ui and React-router.
